Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow. It includes loading and exploring a dataset in Python, performing data cleaning, running SQL queries for deeper analysis, creating a Power BI dashboard for visualization, and preparing a final report and presentation using Gamma.
The goal is to showcase strong analytical thinking, technical skills, and the ability to present insights effectively.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains customer purchase data (or replace with your dataset description).

It includes columns such as demographic details, purchase behavior, product categories, and transaction information.

The dataset was used to perform exploratory analysis, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn, Jupyter Notebook)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI (interactive dashboard creation)

Gamma App (for final PPT presentation)

Excel (optional data checks)

📘 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading (Python)

Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Inspected structure, dimensions, and basic info.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated summary statistics.

Visualized trends using bar charts, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.

Identified missing values, outliers, and distribution patterns.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values using imputation techniques.

Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistent categories.

Created new features (e.g., age groups, purchase frequency categories).

4. SQL Analysis

Executed several SQL queries to:

Calculate KPIs (total sales, avg purchase value, repeat purchase rate).

Segment customers (by category, season, frequency).

Identify top-selling and low-performing items.

Measure discount effectiveness.

Queries were tested on PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.

5. Power BI Dashboard

Created an interactive dashboard that includes:

Sales overview

Customer segmentation

Purchase trends

Product performance

Discount vs. non-discount behavior

6. Report & Presentation (Gamma)

Summarized findings in a clear, business-friendly report.

Created a PPT-style presentation using Gamma to convey insights visually for stakeholders.

📊 Dashboard Preview

(Add a screenshot or link to your Power BI dashboard if available.)

📈 Results & Insights

Some key insights discovered (modify according to your project):

High-value customers tend to purchase more frequently during specific seasons.

Discounts significantly increase purchase count but reduce profit margin in certain categories.

A few product categories drive most of the revenue.

Younger age groups show higher engagement with digital payment methods.

▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd project-folder

2. Install Required Python Packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open the notebook and execute the cells to perform EDA and cleaning.

4. Execute SQL Queries

Import the cleaned dataset into:

PostgreSQL or

MySQL or

SQL Server

Then run SQL scripts from the /sql folder.

5. Open the Power BI File

Open dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop.

6. View the Final Report

Open the Gamma PPT link or file included in the repository.
